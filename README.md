# [Project 1: Heart Failure Prediction](https://github.com/malmuntazarharris/heart-failure-prediction)
Exploring a dataset of heart disease patients and predicting the mortality based on their comorbities and laboratory test parameters

* Load the dataset and identify the features included in the dataset
* Explore the dataset and find any trends or correlations with the features
* Preprocess the dataset for modeling
* Create models with all the features in the dataset
* Identify important features and produce models only including these features
* Create models with only ejection fraction and serum creatinine
* Compare the performances of all the models created

# [Project 2: Current World Weather Dashboard: Project Overview](https://github.com/malmuntazarharris/WeatherDashboard)
* Scraped a list of countries, capitals, continents and their coordinate locations
* Cleaned the data from the scraped website and replaced incorrect/mispelled values
* Created classes in Python to represent cities, countries and weather for the city
* Pulled weather data using OpenWeather.org API
* Stored weather data in PostgresSQL database
